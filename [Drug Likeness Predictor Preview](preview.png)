#💊 Drug-Likeness Analyzer

A beginner-friendly cheminformatics tool that checks whether a molecule is drug-like using *Lipinski's Rule of Five*.

# 🔬 What is Lipinski’s Rule of Five?
A molecule is considered *drug-like* if it satisfies:
✅ Molecular weight ≤ 500 Dalton  
✅ LogP ≤ 5  
✅ Hydrogen bond donors ≤ 5  
✅ Hydrogen bond acceptors ≤ 10

## 📂 Project Features
✅ Takes a *SMILES string* as input  
✅ Calculates molecular weight, LogP, H-bond donors/acceptors  
✅ Uses *RDKit* for cheminformatics  
✅ Provides pass/fail based on Lipinski's criteria

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 3
RDKit
Google Colab (.ipynb)

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JuhiKumari508/druglikeness-analyzer.git
2.  Open the drug_likeness_predictor.ipynb in  Google Colab.
3. Run the code and input your molecule’s SMILES string:
check_drug_likeness("CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O")  # Aspirin
4. Example Output
Molecular Weight: 180.15899999999996
LogP: 1.3101
H-bond Donors: 1
H-bond Acceptors: 3
✅ Result: Drug-like (Lipinski compliant)
